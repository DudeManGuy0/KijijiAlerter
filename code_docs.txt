Scout():
	scans for new listings every set amount of time.
	first, it makes a base scrape. it gets all of the current listings
	and saves it to alreadyScrapedListings. from there it will start a
	loop of scraping every set amount of time. It gets the listings and
	if its in alreadyScrapdListings, it discards them. If the listing is
	new it will get shown then put in alreadyScrapedListings so it wont be
	picked up again in the future.

ScoutMultiple():
	a more advanced version of Scout. It pairs searchParamers with alreadyScrapedListings in a dictionary
	and make it into a list to support passing multiple SearchParameters in. This effectivly binds each
	SearchParameter to its resulting scrape. After it initializes each pair and has the 'base' reffered to
	in Scout(), it will iterate over each pair inside the list of pairs. Each iteration will get a new set 
	of scraped listings and compare them with alreadyScrapedListings in the pair it comes with. It is in a
	nutshell, Scout() logic but done with more SearchParameters which are paird with their alreadyScrapedListings.
